## 2024-03-XX: SQLite Insert Batching Optimization
- **Problem:** Loop iterations calling `insert.run()` (e.g. for `run_events`, `step_results`, `run_artifacts`) exhibit the N+1 anti-pattern, repeatedly crossing the Node.js / C++ boundary even inside a transaction.
- **Solution:** Utilize chunked batching with multi-row `VALUES (?, ?), (?, ?)` inserts.
- **Learning:** `better-sqlite3` is highly optimized for prepared statement loops inside a transaction, so raw wall-clock time reduction might appear small on local NVMe storage. However, batching reduces the number of SQLite VM operations and the boundary crossings by a factor of the chunk size (e.g., 100x), significantly reducing CPU overhead per insert, memory churn, and potential transaction lock duration under load.
